qdstat -c
~~~~~~~~~
id::
The connection's unique identifier.

The connection's role:
  - 'normal' - The normal connection from a client to a router.
  - 'inter-router' - The connection between routers to form a network.
  - 'route-container' - The connection to or from a broker or other host to receive link routes and waypoints.

  - 'out' - The connection was initiated by this router.

security::
The security or encryption method, if any, used for this connection.

authentication::
The authentication method and user ID of the connection's authenticated user.

tenant::
If the connection is to a listener using multi-tenancy, this column displays the tenant namespace for the connection.

qdstat -l
~~~~~~~~~
type::
The type of link:
  - 'router-control' - An inter-router link that is reserved for control messages exchanged between routers.
  - 'inter-router' - An inter-router link that is used for normal message-routed deliveries.
  - 'endpoint' - A normal link to an external endpoint container.

dir::
The direction that messages flow on the link:
  - 'in' - Deliveries flow inbound to the router.
  - 'out' - Deliveries flow outbound from the router.

conn id::
The unique identifier of the connection over which this link is
attached.

id::
The unique identifier of this link.

peer::
For link-routed links, the unique identifier of the peer link. In
link routing, an inbound link is paired with an outbound link.

class::
The class of the address bound to the link:
  - 'local' - The address that is local to this router (temporary).
  - 'topo' - A topological address used for router control messages.
  - 'router' - A summary router address used to route messages to a remote routerâ€™s local addresses.
  - 'mobile' - A mobile address for an attached consumer or producer.
  - 'link-in' - The address match for incoming routed links.
  - 'link-out' - The address match for outgoing routed links.

addr::
The address bound to the link.

phs::
The phase of the address bound to the link.

cap::
The capacity, in deliveries, of the link.

pri::
The priority of the link.  Priority influences the order in which links are processed within a connection.
Higher numbers represent higher priorities.

undel::
The number of undelivered messages stored on the link's FIFO.

unsett::
The number of unsettled deliveries being tracked by the link.

del::
The total number of deliveries that have transited this link.

presett::
The number of pre-settled deliveries that transited this link.

psdrop::
The number of pre-settled deliveries that were dropped due to congestion.

acc::
The number of deliveries on this link that were accepted.

rej::
The number of deliveries on this link that were rejected.

rel::
The number of deliveries on this link that were released.

mod::
The number of deliveries on this link that were modified.

delay::
The number of settled deliveries on this link that were unsettled for more than one second.

rate::
The average rate (over a period of five seconds) at which deliveries have been settled on this link.

admin::
The administrative status of the link:
  - 'enabled' - The link is enabled for normal operation.
  - 'disabled' - The link is disabled and should be quiescing or stopped (not yet supported).

oper::
The operational status of the link:
  - 'up' - The link is operational.
  - 'down' - The link is not attached.
  - 'quiescing' - The link is in the process of quiescing (not yet supported).
  - 'idle' - The link has completed quiescing and is idle (not yet supported).

name::
The link name (only shown if the -v option is provided).

qdstat -n
^^^^^^^^^

router-id::
The router's ID.

next-hop::
If this router is not a neighbor, this field identifies the next-hop neighbor used to reach this router.

link::
The ID of the link to the neighbor router.

cost::
The topology cost to this remote router (with -v option only).

neighbors::
The list of neighbor routers (the router's link-state). This field is available only if you specify the -v option.

valid-origins::
The list of origin routers for which the best path to the listed router passes through this router (available only with the -v option).

qdstat -a
~~~~~~~~~

class::
The class of the address:
  - 'local' - The address that is local to this router.
  - 'topo' - The topological address used for router control messages.
  - 'router' - A summary router address used to route messages to a remote router's local addresses.
  - 'mobile' - A mobile address for an attached consumer or producer.

addr::
The address text.

phs::
For mobile addresses only, the phase of the address. Direct addresses have only a phase 0. Waypoint addresses have multiple phases, normally 0 and 1.

distrib::
One of the following distribution methods used for this address:
  - 'multicast' - A copy of each message is delivered once to each consumer for the address.
  - 'closest' - Each message is delivered to only one consumer for the address. The closest (lowest cost) consumer will be chosen. If there are multiple lowest-cost consumers, deliveries will be spread across those consumers.
  - 'balanced' - Each message is delivered to only one consumer for the address. The consumer with the fewest outstanding (unsettled) deliveries will be chosen. The cost of the route to the consumer is a threshold for delivery (that is, higher cost consumers will only receive deliveries if closer consumers are backed up).
  - 'flood' - Used only for router-control traffic. This is multicast without the prevention of duplicate deliveries.

pri::
The priority of the address.  If the address prefix/pattern is configured with a priority, that priority will appear
in this column.  Messages for addresses configured with a priority will be forwarded according to the address's priority.

in-proc::
The number of in-process consumers for this address.

local::
For this router, the number of local consumers for this address, or for link-routed addresses, the number of locally-attached containers that are destinations for this address.

remote::
The number of remote routers that have at least one consumer for this address.

in::
The number of deliveries for this address that entered the network on this router.

out::
The number of deliveries for this address that exited the network on this router.

thru::
The number of deliveries for this address that were forwarded to other routers.

to-proc::
The number of deliveries for this address that were delivered to an in-process consumer.

from-proc::
The number of deliveries for this address that were received from an in-process producer.

qdstat --linkroutes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

prefix::
The address prefix of the link route.

dir::
The direction of matching links (from this router's perspective).

distrib::
The distribution method used for routed links. This value should always be 'linkBalanced', which is the only supported distribution for routed links.

status::
The operational status of the link route:
  - 'active' - The route is actively routing attaches (it is ready for use).
  - 'inactive' - The route is inactive, because no local destination is connected.

qstat --autolinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
addr::
The auto link's address.

dir::
The direction that messages flow over the auto link:
  - 'in' - Messages flow in from the route-container to the router network.
  - 'out' - Messages flow out to the route-container from the router network.

phs::
The address phase for this auto link.

link::
The ID of the link managed by this auto link.

status::
The operational status of this auto link:
  - 'inactive' - There is no connected container for this auto link.
  - 'attaching' - The link is attaching to the container.
  - 'failed' - The link-attach failed.
  - 'active' - The link is operational.
  - 'quiescing' - The link is quiescing (not yet supported).
  - 'idle' - The link is idle (not yet supported).

lastErr::
The description of the last attach failure that occurred on this auto link.
